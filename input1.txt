Language extensions to be implemented by the student:
 - Add a bool built-in type to your compiler.
 - Add the true and false constants (literals).
 - Bool expressions could be written and assigned (both LHS and RHS must be bool).
 - if and while conditions *must* be bool (no longer int; i.e., like Java).
