The sole purpose of this repository id to help those interested on designing a Compiler (perhaps a future me), as other similar repositories did help me when creating this one. In case a course is been taken regarding a similar lecture, be advised that you can get as much inspiration as you please, but that the teacher may not like it if its too similar ＞﹏＜

The whole process is not complete (I started with this idea midway through) and is divided into "Laboratory sessions", on which we handed in our code.

There are two branches, with an exam example. The task was to include Booleans as part of the compiler (if I don't forget I will place the exam question itself)
